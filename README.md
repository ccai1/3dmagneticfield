# 3dmagneticfield

##Cathy and Fiona Cai

This is a 3D magnetic field visualizer written in Javascript.
It uses magnetic field vectors to model:
* Current Lines
* Moving Charges
* Current Loops
* Solenoids

The user is able to vary:
* Current magnitude (for current carrying wire and current loop)
* Length (of Current carrying wire)
* Radius (of Current loop and solenoid)
* Number of loops (for solenoid)
* Vector density (toggle the level of vector density, represented by the number of vectors in a given pixelated area)

The user is able to drag their mouse around the 3D canvas and visualize the objects in all three axis, and use the reset button to reset the canvas to a default, singular current line.
